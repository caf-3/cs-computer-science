# Timing our code
We will how learn to write better code
But **Better** is when it's...
- **Faster** ?
- **Less** memory-intensive ?
- **More** readable ?

## The problem with time
- Different machines will record different times.
- The *same* machine will record different times!
- For fast algorithms, speed measurements may not be precise enough.
